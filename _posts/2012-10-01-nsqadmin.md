`nsqadmin` is a Web UI to view aggregated cluster stats in realtime and perform various
administrative tasks.

    -nsqd-http-address value
        nsqd HTTP address (may be given multiple times)
    -proxy-graphite
        proxy HTTP requests to graphite
    -statsd-counter-format string
        The counter stats key formatting applied by the implementation of statsd. If no formatting is desired, set this to an empty string. (default "stats.counters.%s.count")
    -statsd-gauge-format string
        The gauge stats key formatting applied by the implementation of statsd. If no formatting is desired, set this to an empty string. (default "stats.gauges.%s")
    -statsd-interval duration
        time interval nsqd is configured to push to statsd (must match nsqd) (default 1m0s)
    -statsd-prefix string
        prefix used for keys sent to statsd (%s for host replacement, must match nsqd) (default "nsq.%s")
    -verbose
        [deprecated] has no effect, use --log-level
    -version
        print version string

### statsd / Graphite Integration

When using `nsqd --statsd-address=...` you can specify a `nsqadmin
--graphite-url=https://graphite.yourdomain.com` to enable graphite charts in `nsqadmin`. If using a
statsd clone (like [statsdaemon][statsdaemon]) that does not prefix keys, also specify
`--use-statsd-prefix=false`.

### Admin Notifications

If the `--notification-http-endpoint` flag is set, `nsqadmin` will send a POST request to the
specified (fully qualified) endpoint each time an admin action (such as pausing a channel) is
performed.

The body of the request contains information about the action (some fields will be omitted when appropriate), like so:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "action": "unpause_channel",
  "channel": "mouth",
  "topic": "beer",
  "timestamp": 1357683731,
  "user": "df",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Iphone 8)",
  "remote_ip": "1.2.3.4:5678",
  "url": "http://nsqadmin.local/api/topics/api_requests/nsq_to_file",
  "via": "localhost"
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `user` field will be filled if a HTTP Basic Authentication Username is present in the request made to `nsqadmin`,
say if it were running with htpasswd authentication or behind [`oauth2_proxy`][oauth2_proxy].

Hint: You can create an NSQ stream of admin action notifications with the topic name `admin_actions`
by setting `--notification-http-endpoint` to point to the `nsqd` [HTTP Publish API]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/nsqd.html#post-pub). For example if running `nsqd` on the same node you could use `--notification-http-endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4151/put?topic=admin_actions"`

There are community contributed utilities [`nsqadmin2slack`][nsqadmin2slack] and [`nsqadmin2hipchat`][nsqadmin2hipchat] to relay messages to HipChat and Slack respectively.

Actions that are captured are:

 * `create_channel`
 * `create_topic`
 * `delete_channel`
 * `delete_topic`
 * `empty_channel`
 * `empty_topic`
 * `pause_channel`
 * `pause_topic`
 * `tombstone_topic_producer`
 * `unpause_channel`
 * `unpause_topic`

### Metrics

The following metrics are exposed through `nsqadmin` on Topic, Channel and Client Connections.

#### Message Queues:

* `Depth`: Current sum of messages in memory + on disk (i.e. the "backlog" of messages pending delivery).
* `In-Flight`: Current count of messages delivered but not yet finished (`FIN`), requeued (`REQ`) or timed out.
* `Deferred`: Current count of messages that were requeued and explicitly deferred which are not yet available for delivery.

#### Statistics:

* `Requeued`: Total times a message has been added back to the queue due to time outs or explicit requeues.
* `Timed Out`: Total times a message has been requeued after not receiving a response from the client before the configured timeout.
* `Messages`: Total count of new messages recieved since node startup.
* `Rate`: The per-second rate of new messages over the previous two statsd intervals (available only when graphite integration is enabled).
* `Connections`: Current number of connected clients.

#### Client Connections:

* `Client Host`: Client ID (hostname) and on-hover the connection remote-address.
* `Protocol`: NSQ protocol version and client user-agent.
* `Attributes`: TLS and AUTH connection state.
* `NSQd Host`: Address of the nsqd node this client is connected to.
* `In-flight`: Current count of messages awaiting response that have been delivered to this client.
* `Ready Count`: Max number of messages that can be in-flight on this connection. This is controlled by a client's `max_in_flight` setting.
* `Finished`: Total count of messages that this client has finished (`FIN`).
* `Requeued`: Total count of messages that this client has requeued (`REQ`).
* `Messages`: Total count of messages delivered to this client.
