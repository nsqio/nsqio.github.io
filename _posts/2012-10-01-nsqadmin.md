`nsqadmin` is a Web UI to view aggregated cluster stats in realtime and perform various
administrative tasks.

    -statsd-counter-format string
        The counter stats key formatting applied by the implementation of statsd. If no formatting is desired, set this to an empty string. (default "stats.counters.%s.count")
    -statsd-gauge-format string
        The gauge stats key formatting applied by the implementation of statsd. If no formatting is desired, set this to an empty string. (default "stats.gauges.%s")
    -statsd-interval duration
        time interval nsqd is configured to push to statsd (must match nsqd) (default 1m0s)
    -statsd-prefix string
        prefix used for keys sent to statsd (%s for host replacement, must match nsqd) (default "nsq.%s")
    -verbose
        [deprecated] has no effect, use --log-level
    -version
        print version string

### statsd / Graphite Integration

When using `nsqd --statsd-address=...` you can specify a `nsqadmin
--graphite-url=https://graphite.yourdomain.com` to enable graphite charts in `nsqadmin`. If using a
statsd clone (like [statsdaemon][statsdaemon]) that does not prefix keys, also specify
`--use-statsd-prefix=false`.

### Admin Notifications

If the `--notification-http-endpoint` flag is set, `nsqadmin` will send a POST request to the
specified (fully qualified) endpoint each time an admin action (such as pausing a channel) is
performed.

The body of the request contains information about the action (some fields will be omitted when appropriate), like so:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "action": "unpause_channel",
  "channel": "mouth",
  "topic": "beer",
  "timestamp": 1357683731,
  "user": "df",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Iphone 8)",
  "remote_ip": "1.2.3.4:5678",
  "url": "http://nsqadmin.local/api/topics/api_requests/nsq_to_file",
  "via": "localhost"
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `user` field will be filled if a HTTP Basic Authentication Username is present in the request made to `nsqadmin`,
say if it were running with htpasswd authentication or behind [`oauth2_proxy`][oauth2_proxy].

Hint: You can create an NSQ stream of admin action notifications with the topic name `admin_actions`
by setting `--notification-http-endpoint` to point to the `nsqd` [HTTP Publish API]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/nsqd.html#post-pub). For example if running `nsqd` on the same node you could use `--notification-http-endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4151/put?topic=admin_actions"`

There are community contributed utilities [`nsqadmin2slack`][nsqadmin2slack] and [`nsqadmin2hipchat`][nsqadmin2hipchat] to relay messages to HipChat and Slack respectively.

Actions that are captured are:

 * `create_channel`
 * `create_topic`
 * `delete_channel`
 * `delete_topic`
 * `empty_channel`
 * `empty_topic`
 * `pause_channel`
 * `pause_topic`
 * `tombstone_topic_producer`
 * `unpause_channel`
 * `unpause_topic`

### Metrics

The following metrics are exposed through `nsqadmin` on Topic, Channel and Client Connections.

#### Message Queues:

* `Depth`: Current sum of messages in memory + on disk (i.e. the "backlog" of messages pending delivery).
* `In-Flight`: Current count of messages delivered but not yet finished (`FIN`), requeued (`REQ`) or timed out.
* `Deferred`: Current count of messages that were requeued and explicitly deferred which are not yet available for delivery.

#### Statistics:

* `Requeued`: Total times a message has been added back to the queue due to time outs or explicit requeues.
* `Timed Out`: Total times a message has been requeued after not receiving a response from the client before the configured timeout.
* `Messages`: Total count of new messages recieved since node startup.
* `Rate`: The per-second rate of new messages over the previous two statsd intervals (available only when graphite integration is enabled).
* `Connections`: Current number of connected clients.
* `Delivery`: Messages delivered to consumers in each topology category (zoneLocal, regionLocal, global) over the lifetime of the host by percentage (available only when topology-aware-consumption experiment is enabled in nsqd and messages > 0)

#### Client Connections:

* `Client Host`: Client ID (hostname) and on-hover the connection remote-address.
* `Protocol`: NSQ protocol version and client user-agent.
* `Attributes`: TLS and AUTH connection state, topology category with respect to the nsqd host (zoneLocal, regionLocal, global).
* `NSQd Host`: Address of the nsqd node this client is connected to.
* `In-flight`: Current count of messages awaiting response that have been delivered to this client.
* `Ready Count`: Max number of messages that can be in-flight on this connection. This is controlled by a client's `max_in_flight` setting.
* `Finished`: Total count of messages that this client has finished (`FIN`).
* `Requeued`: Total count of messages that this client has requeued (`REQ`).
* `Messages`: Total count of messages delivered to this client.

If the topology aware consumption experiment is enabled for the nsqd host, client connections in the same zone as the nsqd host will be displayed in green. Client connections in the same region but a different zone as the nsqd host will be displayed in yellow.
